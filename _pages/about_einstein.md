PhD student in the History of Science, studying women, gender and all things nineteenth-century British astronomy. Member of the International Max Planck Research School: Knowledge and its Resource, based at the Max Planck Research Institute for the History of Science. 

Computer scientist and mathematician in a previous life, making some use of those skills by managing the website for the [British Society for the History of Mathematics](https://bshm.ac.uk/). Otherwise found running when my knees hold themselves together for long enough and doodling on the U-Bahn commutes.
