2026 as the year of new websites
---

Finally got around to shifting my personal website from Notion to Jekyll, after admiring the website of a fair few academics. Hoping to keep the world more updated with what I'm doing and where I am, the latter of which being quite hard to keep up with. Have to spend more time in Berlin this year...

Also launched recently is the <a href="https://bshm.ac.uk/">BSHM website</a>, graciously designed by Alexander Stoeger. With the relaunch of the website, we've relaunched the <a href="https://bshm.ac.uk/blog/">blog</a> - be sure to check out the recent posts.
